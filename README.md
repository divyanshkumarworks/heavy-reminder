## About
This is webbase refernce app built in Django and Javascript demonstrates how to leverage [Twilio Programmable Voice](https://www.twilio.com/voice) and [Twilio SDKs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries) to create a Task reminder system to remind people about the tasks by calling to your customers to deliver time-sensitive messages. This app is helpful for people who need to be reminding about the tasks.

In addition, An ngrok server is required so that Twilio can locate your server and invoke the webhooks on every call status update.

### Other

- For local development the application uses an [ngrok server](https://ngrok.com/). Without it, Twilio cannot invoke the call-status-update webhook that runs from your local server. Ngrok [enforces a limit of 40 connections per minute](https://ngrok.com/pricing#:~:text=Per%20user%20limits%3A,-5%20reserved%20domains&text=2%20online%20ngrok%20processes,120%20connections%2Fminute) so be mindful about this limitation.
